# Customising-your-Dev-Environment
A simple beginner-friendly custom terminal setup.
<br>
Feel free to use and edit this config as you see fit.
Will be adding further upgrades to the terminal and lazyvim in the future.

## Run
run the script setup.sh in WSL or a Linux system.

` NOTE: In case you are running this in WSL, install the nerd fonts separately. `

```shell
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```
